We are delighted to officially announce AIDE version 2!
Highlights:
* Multi-project support: create and configure as many annotation projects as you like through the Web browser, all on one installation of AIDE.
* Powerful new models: AIDE v2 officially includes [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and comes with a plethora of powerful, deep learning-based models, from ResNet over Faster R-CNN to DeepLabV3+ (see [below](#built-in-ai-models)).
* Model Marketplace: choose from a variety of pre-trained deep learning models to start with good quality predictions from the first few labels. Contribute and share your own models with other people or across projects.
* Expansive quality control: monitor the progress and accuracy of users and models with a few clicks through the browser.

There's lots more to discover. Check out the [demo](#demo) or [get started](#installation-and-launching-aide) straightaway!

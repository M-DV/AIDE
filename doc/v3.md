# AIDE v3.0

Exciting news: AIDE version 3.0 is on the way! This is the **nightly** build of it, thus with a plethora of bugs and (yet) unfinished code. Do not use for production environments.


## Status of planned features

Legend:
:red_circle: = development not started yet
:clock3: = work in progress
:ballot_box_with_check: = first version working, needs testing
:white_check_mark: = completed


* :ballot_box_with_check: Undo/redo functionality: implemented; to be tested completely. Redo functionality still buggy (check stacks).
* :clock3: Support for new image formats:
  * :white_check_mark: TIFF image parsing: :white_check_mark: Web frontend works (might need testing with exotic TIFFs); :white_check_mark: backend works
  * :clock3: DICOM image parsing: :red_circle: Web frontend to be implemented (Daikon library); :clock3: backend prototype works (cannot save images; no metadata is kept)
* :white_check_mark: Support for auto-conversion of semi-supported image formats. In AIDE v3.0 and above, some image formats may be supported by the new ImageDriver framework but not by the Web front-end. These are denoted as "semi-supported" and will be automatically renamed and converted upon upload to a fully supported format (currently TIFF). First tests work for e.g. ERDAS Imagine files (*.img), as well as formats consisting of multiple files like headers, but more tests are needed.
  * :ballot_box_with_check: Implemented band selection on server side; currently causes warning messages and needs testing
  * :clock3: Annotation interface loads image up to three times for some reasons (Promise chains?)
* :white_check_mark: Image rendering adjustments for Web frontend (grayscale render configuration might needs minor UI adjustments)
* :ballot_box_with_check: Support for polygons (to be implemented: polygon union, individual vertex selection and deletion, general minor bug fixes)
* :clock3: New models for polygons: Detectron2 detectors (Faster R-CNN & Co.) work with polygons as input; dedicated models to be implemented
* :ballot_box_with_check: Advanced segmentation labeling tools: :white_check_mark: paint bucket; :ballot_box_with_check: rectangle (first version working; probably still a bit buggy), :ballot_box_with_check: polygon (might need improvements); :white_check_mark: magnetic polygon; :white_check_mark: magic wand; :white_check_mark: Grab Cut; :white_check_mark: polygon simplification and convex hull; :clock3: select similar (still not working as it should)
* :clock3: New Models:
  * :ballot_box_with_check: YOLOv5 for Detectron2 (first prototype working; expansion towards new model weights still missing; settings/hyperparams need GUI impl.). :white_check_mark: MegaDetector v5 configs implemented.
  * :ballot_box_with_check: U-net for Detectron2 (first prototype working; currently no pre-trained model states)
  * :ballot_box_with_check: [DeepForest and BirdDetector](https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest) (first prototype working; needs to be tested)
* :white_check_mark: Virtual views for images implemented
* :ballot_box_with_check: Annotation im-/export: basic functionality and some parsers implemented; need more testing. More parsers (e.g., PASCAL VOC, ESRI ShapeFile, GeoJSON) to be coded.
* :ballot_box_with_check: support for geospatial projects
  * :ballot_box_with_check: image upload stores SRID and image extent
  * :clock3: currently no action in case of project and image SRID mismatch
  * Mapservers: basic versions running.
    * :ballot_box_with_check: basic WMS, WCS, WFS implemented, although still in alpha
    * :clock3: missing: custom SRID (currently fails with non-WGS84), more service versions, extended parameters, GeoJSON output for WFS, general failsafety
    * :clock3: project config page implemented; options not yet used (all services on by default; insufficient authentication check, also for demo projects)
    * :clock3: needs extensive testing



More functionality might come and will be added to this list as implementations progress.

AIDE is two things in one: <i>a tool for manually annotating images</i> and <i>a tool for training and running machine (deep) learning models</i>. Those two things are coupled in an <i>active learning loop</i>: the human annotates a few images, the system trains a model, that model is used to make predictions and to select more images for the human to annotate, etc.
   
More generally, AIDE is a modular Web framework for labeling image datasets with AI assistance.  AIDE is configurable for a variety of tasks, but it is particularly intended for ecological applications, such as the acceleration wildlife surveys that use aerial images. 

AIDE is primarily developed by [Benjamin Kellenberger](https://bkellenb.github.io). The project emerged within the [Microsoft AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program but is now implemented independently.

## Highlights

* **Powerful:** AIDE explicitly integrates humans and AI models in an annotation loop.
* **Fast:** AIDE has been designed with speed in mind, both in terms of computations and workflow.
* **Flexible:** The framework allows full customizability, from hyperparameters to models to annotation types to libraries. It provides:
    * Support for image classification, point annotations, and bounding boxes (object detection)
    * Many deep learning-based AI models and Active Learning criteria built-in
    * Interfaces for custom AI models and criteria, using any framework or library you want (see how to [write your own model](doc/custom_model.md)).
* **Fully featured:** Beyond image labeling and model training, AIDE has management and graphical user/machine performance evaluation tools built-in, right in the web browser, allowing for advanced, manual label quality checks.
* **Modular:** AIDE is separated into individual _modules_, each of which can be run on separate machines for scalability. It even supports on-the-fly addition of computational workers for computationally intensive model training!

## News

### April 26, 2024
AIDE has moved to its new home:
[https://github.com/bkellenb/AIDE](https://github.com/bkellenb/AIDE). All future code developments
will happen in this repository. Note that this builds on the yet to be officially releaset version
3.0 (see [here](doc/v3.md) for development status).

All models can be configured in various ways through the AI model settings page in the Web browser. They all are pre-trained on [ImageNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848) unless specified otherwise.
To use one of the built-in models, simply import the requested one to your project through the Model Marketplace in the Web browser and start training/predicting!




### Writing your own AI model
AIDE is fully modular and supports custom AI models, as long as they provide a Python interface and can handle at least one of the different annotation and prediction types appropriately.
We greatly welcome contributions and are happy to help in the implementation of your custom models!

See [here](doc/custom_model.md) for instructions on implementing custom models into AIDE.

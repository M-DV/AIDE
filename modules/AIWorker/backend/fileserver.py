'''
    Private file server wrapper, to be used explicitly by the backend.
    Note: this instance does not do any user verification or authentication
    check; it is therefore imperative that it may never be exposed to the
    frontend.
    An instance of this FileServer class may be provided to the AIModel instead,
    and serves as a gateway to the project's actual file server.
